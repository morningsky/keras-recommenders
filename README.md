# Keras Recommenders

Keras Recommenders is a library for building recommender system models using [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).

It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation on recommender system. 

It's built on Keras and aims to have a gentle learning curve in recommender models.



**Note:** Currently, Keras-recommenders is only support multi task learning framework, more models is preparing!

Welcome to join us!

## Installation

Make sure you have TensorFlow 2.x  and [DeepCTR](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR) installed, and install from `pip`:

```python
pip install keras-recommenders
```

## Quick Start

```python
from keras_recommenders.ple import PLE 

model = PLE(dnn_feature_columns, num_tasks=2, task_types=['binary', 'binary'], task_names=['task 1','task 2'], num_levels=2, num_experts_specific=8, num_experts_shared=4, expert_dnn_units=[64,64],  gate_dnn_units=[16,16], tower_dnn_units_lists=[[32,32],[32,32]])

model.compile("adam", loss=["binary_crossentropy", "binary_crossentropy"], metrics=['AUC'])

model.fit(X_train, [y_task1, y_task2], batch_size=256, epochs=5, verbose=2)
pred_ans = model.predict(X_test, batch_size=256)

```

## Multi-task Learning Models for Recommender Systems

Currently this project is developed based on [DeepCTR](https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR) :https://github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR.

You can easy to use the code to design your multi task learning model  for multi regression or classification tasks.

### [Example 1](./example/demo.ipynb)

Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/

Task 1: (Classification) aims to predict whether the income exceeds 50K.

Task 2: (Classification) aims to predict this personâ€™s marital status is never married.

### Example 2

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/
